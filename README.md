# TBGRD
TBGRD is a public database available online. It is  a curated information that combines about 1,947 articles out of which only few were searched and the genes, proteins, receptors and hormones in human and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were collected in a single web application. The genetic data from the host-guest has been carefully gathered, curated, and shown in a publicly available online interface (http://tbgrd.co.in/).We have collected all the known databases upto date. None of the databases have the information regarding human response to tuberculosis infection. Adjoining of the host-guest genomic interaction data was done with World Health Organisation and hyperlink with PubMed records. The database can be searched by their weblink provided, organism, type, each database details and database name. As a result, TBGRD serves as a centralised resource for tuberculosis researchers to access host-guest genetic data.
